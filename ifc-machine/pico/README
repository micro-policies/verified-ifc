This is a proof of non-interference for the pico IFC machine.

This code is known to work with Coq 8.4.

-- Content
   
   lib        : divers library and utility definitions
   common     : generic theorems 
   tmu/mach_exec: executable def of the machine - old files -- stalled
   tmu/amach  : definition of the abstract machine 
   tmu/cmach  : definition of the concrete machine 
   tmu/amach_ni: non-interference for abstract machine
   tmu/abstract_ni : abstract definition of NI and proof
   extraction : extraction script and extraction directory

-- Compile
        make all
   This will compile the coq definitions and proofs and
   extract the code of the machine into Haskell files.

-- Coqtop and library paths...
   
   For using coqtop easily: 
   
   For Emacs under version 23: 
   1) Modify config.el.example by setting the absolute path of the directory
      safeqc/coq
   2) Save this new file as config.el
   3) Load this file anytime you want to coqtop a .v file
      
   For Emacs > 23: use directory locals. The example should work:
   
     ln -s example.dir-locals.el .dir-locals.el

-- Git Svn

   If you are using Git Svn (if you don't know what this means, then
   you are not using it), note that there is a .gitignore file in this
   directory.
