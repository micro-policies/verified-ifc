- Change concrete machine to use Z tags instead of labels throughout.
- Change Push instruction to take a bare Z rather than an atom; many consequent
simplifications since instructions no longer depend on lattice.
- Add BOT as a symbolic label expression, with associated genBot code
and proof of correctness.  (This is needed so that rule for Push can 
return bottom.)
- Rename glue functions and move them to FaultHandler.v
