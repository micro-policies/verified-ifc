This directory contains the Coq developments corresponding to the machines
described in the paper "A Verified Information-Flow Architecture."

There are three subdirectories:

/basic_machines         corresponds to the basic model discussed in sections 3-10 of the paper.
/extended_machines      corresponds to the machine extensions discussed in section 11

Nearly everything developed in /basic_machines reappears in /extended_machines,
but sometimes in modified form.

We recommend that you start by exploring /basic_machines. Consult the README
and the Main.v file to get a top-level view of the results.

/extended_machines contain longer READMEs that are intended to help
guide you to the important differences in these developments.

The code in the three directories is known to work with Coq 8.4.
