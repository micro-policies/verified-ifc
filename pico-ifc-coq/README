This directory contains the Coq developments corresponding to the machines
described in the paper "A Verified Information-Flow Architecture."

There are three subdirectories:

/basic_machines         corresponds to the basic model discussed in sections 3-10 of the paper. 
/dyn_allocation         corresponds to the extension to dynamic allocation discussed in section 11
/sets_of_principals	corresponds to the extension to sets of principals discussed in section 11

Nearly everything developed in /basic_machines reappears in the other two directories,
but sometimes in modified form.

We recommend that you start by exploring /basic_machines. Consult the README
and the Main.v file to get a top-level view of the results.

The other two directories contain longer READMEs that are intended to help
guide you to the important differences in these developments.

The code in the three directories is known to work with Coq 8.4.
